# Personal-Protective-Equipment-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision
Health and safety are very important to be applied to all companies, and one of the important elements arranged by occupational health and safety is the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). They are equipment that have to be worn to enhance the worker safeness, and they have different standard for every workplace. 8 from 10 companies have rules to control the employee to wear personal protective equipment all the time whenever they work in a specific area. The number of work accidents happened in construction sites does not decrease, in this moment. One of the causes of work accidents is human negligence in wearing personal protective equipment or what is called PPE. A system that can monitor the completeness of PPE worn by workers in an industrial environment automatically is needed. Computer vision technology is used to monitor directly and detect workers who do not wear PPE.
